Purpose 
		-This simple application is inspired by my own experience.
		Since this year started (2022) , i have been in my fitness journey.
		This June is my sixth month, and i have already lost 22kg. Therefore, i decided
		to build a simple system linked to my own experience.
		

Functionalities
1.User can enter food name
2.User can enter food calorie
3.User can enter target calorie(for that day)
4.User can use add button to add those inputs in the table
5.User can clear all the inputs in just one click
6.User can reset entries in the table
7.User can view the sum of calories each time he/she has added an entry
8.In the table, user can still edit all the added entry in the table (names and calorie)
9.User can disable and enable entries simultaneously(calories sum will change and color of the row to gray  when entry is disabled)
I have used enable/disable rather than delete for some people who are food conscious tend to know the food they should cut to avoid exceeded target calories on the next following days.
10. A message alert will show up when the user food entries calories sum on that day exceeded the target calories
	
Other functionalities
	1.Can be viewed without problem in User interface on your mobile and desktop (Responsive)

	
Own critique
	1. For better user experience, API can be very useful to have intellisense for foods list  and make the calorie number automatically filled out
